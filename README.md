## Maintainers

Maintainers is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that identifies project maintainers and dependencies' authors by parsing package manager files (`package.json`, `composer.json`, `go.mod`, etc.).

It helps you discover who is behind the libraries you use and provides an easy way to support them.

### Features

- Maintainer Detection: Automatically scans your project for package manager files.
- Contribution Impact: See how many packages each author maintains in your project.
- Direct Sponsorship: Quick access to funding links like GitHub Sponsors and Open Collective.

## Donation

Open-source tools can greatly improve workflows, helping developers and businesses save time and increase revenue.
Many successful projects have been built on these tools, benefiting a wide community.
However, maintaining and enhancing these resources requires continuous effort and investment.

Support from the community helps keep these projects alive and ensures they remain useful for everyone.
Donations play a key role in sustaining and improving these open-source initiatives.
